# Functional-GS
Dunia Pino del Carpio, Roberto Lozano, et al.
Channel created to compile and share code for a functional GS article.
	We aim to improve genomic prediction models by
	
	-prioritizing SNPs with known biological/genomic function and following a multikernel approach
	-adjusting kinship matrices with an LD weight/score correction
	-annotating snps into genome structure categories: intro,exon,UTRs,etc	
	-including heritability values for genome structure categories
