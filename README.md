# Functional-GS
Dunia Pino del Carpio, Roberto Lozano, et al.
Channel created to compile and share code for a functional GS article
We aim to improve genomic prediction models by
-prioritizing SNPs with known biological/genomic function and following a multikernel approach
-adjusting kinship matrices with an LD weight/score correction
-annotating snps into genome structure categories: intro,exon,UTRs,etc
-including heritability values for genome structure categories
